# ToastrBugApp => Custom toast with [Toastr](https://github.com/scttcper/ngx-toastr) example

This was not bug, the issue was related to the custom toast component selector that needed to be wrapped with `[]` brackets.

Related [issue](https://github.com/scttcper/ngx-toastr/issues/927), big thanks to [@scttcper](https://github.com/scttcper)!
